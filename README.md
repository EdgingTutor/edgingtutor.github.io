Edging tutor (ET) is a browser game that makes you edge. Unlike other games, you are not playing the game - the game will be playing with you! Or rather, with your mind. The idea for ET was born out of a frustration with traditional browser-based masturbation games and JOIs, which are often uncreative, do not fully understand the physiology of sexual arousal and lack the psychological means to *really* make you edge.

This game is different. It will be playing with your mind, while you are playing with yourself. Currently planned features are:

* Red light, green light
* Cum countdowns
* Fake countdowns
* Blind countdowns
* Randomness
* "You have N seconds to cum" mind games
* Orgasm denial, ruined orgasms, chance to cum
* Being able to choose your own porn via a split-screen setup

This game can be played alone or with another person. Settings can be saved and shared via the URL. The game is run entirely in the browser using Javascript, nothing will be saved on the server. You can even download the game, modify it and run it locally without internet connection.

More details will be posted as we go along. This is just a hobby project so it will probably take a long time. Stay tuned ;)
